# api.zitat-service.de

This will be the new API for [zitat-service.de](https://www.zitat-service.de)

## Docker Containers

There is a Docker test and development environment prepared. You can create your own test and development instance with the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/muhme/quote_api
$ cd quote_api
$ docker compose up -d
```

Then you should have three containers running:

```
$ docker ps
IMAGE                        PORTS                        NAMES
quote_api-nodeapp            0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp       quote_api_nodeapp
quote_api-mariadb            3306/tcp                     quote_api_mariadb
phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin        0.0.0.0:8101->80/tcp         quote_api_mysqladmin
```

- quote_api_mariadb – MariaDB database server
